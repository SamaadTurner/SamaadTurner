<h2 align="left">About me</h2>
My name is Samaad Turner and I am from Tacoma, Washington. Before changing careers, I was a student at Central Washington University, where I studied computer science and played football for 2 years.
The reason behind my decision to learn Software Development was driven by the field's robust nature and its ever-evolving potential for innovation.
I specifically chose this skill because I had an enlightening experience with an introductory class in high school, and since then, I found a passion for it and eventually went on to study that in college
The ideal environment for me to use this skill would be at any tech company in the vibrant and dynamic Seattle area, where I can immerse myself in cutting-edge projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals.
My previous experience in the athletic field translated to the software engineering field because it is the same, as far as repetitions and pure GRIT when learning something new.
With my passion, dedication, and strong educational background, I am eager to contribute and thrive in the exciting world of Software Development.
